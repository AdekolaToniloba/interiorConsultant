## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/mNCNSmb/screenbud-f9ccc8df-d657-4e06-a215-4fdb09da3e48.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? => [here](https://intconsult.netlify.app/)
- What was your experience? => It was a good experience, I had to do a little research for the hamburger menu as well as integrating vanilla javascript into the html and css, but they turned out fine.
- Your wisdom? :) Use Google üòè
